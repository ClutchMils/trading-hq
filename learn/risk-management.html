         <h1>🧠 Lesson 4: Risk Management (Why This Is Everything)</h1>
    <h2>The Truth Nobody Likes</h2>
    <p>
        You don't blow accounts because of bad strategy <br>
        <br>
        You blow accounts because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>you risk too much</li>
      <li>you don't respect drawdown</li>
      <li>you let emotions size your trades</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most traders fail <strong>before</strong> their edge has a chance</p>
    <h2>What Risk Actually Means</h2>
    <p>
        Risk is not "how confident you feel" <br>
        <br>
        Risk is: <br>
        <br>
        &vert;<strong> How much of you account you lose if you are wrong.</strong> <br>
        <br>
        Every trade starts with a loss scenario. <br>
        <br>
        If you don't know that number, <strong>you are gambling</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>The Only Rule That Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Risk a <strong>fixed percentage</strong> per trade <br>
        <br>
        Not:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>how good it looks</li>
        <li>how bored you are</li>
        <li>how close the stop is</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Typical:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>0.5% - conservative</li>
        <li>1% - standard</li>
        <li>2% - aggressive</li>
    </ul>
    <p>More than that? You're emotional, not strategic</p>
    <h2>Why Small Risk Wins Long-Term</h2>
    <p>Small risk:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>keeps you in the game</li>
        <li>protects confidence</li>
        <li>allows learning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Big risk:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>amplifies mistakes</li>
        <li>creates fear</li>
        <li>leads to revenge trading</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Survival comes first</p>
    <h2>Risk vs Reward (The Right Way)</h2>
    <p>
        Risk-Reward is not about being right. <br>
        <br>
        it's about:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>losing small</li>
        <li>winning bigger when right</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A trader can be wrong <strong>more than half the time</strong> and still be profitable. <br>
        <br>
        Most beginners don't lose because they're wrong. <br>
        They lose because <strong>their losers are bigger than their winners</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Drawdown is Part of the Game</h2>
    <p>
        Losing streaks are normal. <br>
        <br>
        What matters:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>how deep drawdown goes</li>
        <li>whether you can recover</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If one losing streak can wipe you out, <br>
        your risk is broken.
    </p>
    <h2>The Rule That Saves Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        If you feel emotioanl: <br>
        &vert;<strong>Your risk is too high.</strong> <br>
        <br>
        Always.
    </p>
    <h2>What This Means for You</h2>
    <p>You don't need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>more indicators</li>
        <li>more trades</li>
        <li>more confidence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You need <strong>controlled risk.</strong><br>
        <br>
        Everything else comes after.

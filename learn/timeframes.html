        <h1>🧠 Lesson 2: Timeframes (Why Most Traders Get Trapped)</h1>
    <h2>The Hard Truth About Timeframes</h2>
    <p> 
        Lower timeframes feel exciting.
        They move fast.
        They give you more "signals"

        That's why most beginners lose there.

        Speed hide mistakes.
    </p>
    <h2>What a Timeframe Really Is</h2>
    <p>A timeframe is <strong>just compression of data</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1D = one candle = one full trading day</li>
        <li>4H = one candle = four hours</li>
        <li>1H - one candle = one hour</li>
    </ul>

    <p> 
        Nothing changes except noise level.

        Higher timeframe = clearer intent
        Lower timeframe = more noise
    </p>

    <h2>Why Higher Timeframes Matter More</h2>

    <p>Big money does not trade the 1-minute chart.</p>

    <p>They plan on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Daily</li>
        <li>Weekly</li>
        <li>4H</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The lower you go, the less meaningful each moves becomes.

        Price on 1H matters inside the context of the Daily and 4H.
    </p>
    <h2>The Trap Beginners Fall into</h2>
    <p>Most Beginners:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter on 5M</li>
        <li>Stop out on noise</li>
        <li>Revenge trade</li>
        <li>Repeat</li>
    </ul>
    <p> 
        They think they're "early."
        They're not early.
        They're <strong>wrong timeframe</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>How Timeframe Should Actually Be Used</h2>
    <p>
        One simple rule:

        <strong>
            Higher timeframe gives direction.
            Lower timeframe gives execution.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Daily → overall bias </li>
        <li>4H → key levels</li>
        <li>1H → entries</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If your lower timeframe trade disagrees with the higher timeframe, 
    <strong>you're gambling</strong></p>

    <p>
        If you can't make sense of the Daily chart,
        you have no business trading lower timeframes.

        Slow down.
        Zoom out.
        Let price show its hand.

        The market rewards patience, not activity.

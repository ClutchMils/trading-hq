    <h1>🧠 Lesson 1: What a Market Really Is</h1>

    <h2>What Are We Actually Trading?</h2>
    <p>You are not trading indicators.
You are not trading patterns.
You are not trading lines on a chart.

You are trading people making decisions with money.

Every candle exists because someone bought and someone sold.
That’s it. No magic.

Price moves because orders hit the market.</p>

    <h2>Why Price Moves</h2>
    <p>Price moves when majority of the market agrees on a direction...</p>

    <h2>Who Is In the Market?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Retail traders</li>
        <li>Institutions</li>
        <li>Banks</li>
    </ul>

<h2>What This Means for You as a Trader</h2>
<p>You can make profit or lose base on price movements...</p>

        <h1>🧠 Lesson 1: What a Market Really Is</h1>

    <h2>What Are We Actually Trading?</h2>
    <p> 
        You are not trading indicators.
        You are not trading patterns.
        You are not trading lines on a chart.

        You are trading <strong>people making decisions with money.</strong>

        Every candle exists because someone bought and someone sold.
        That's it. No magic.

        Price moves because  <strong>orders hit the market.</strong> 
    </p>

    <h2>Why Price Moves (The Simple Truth)</h2>
    <p>Price only moves for one reason:

        <strong>More aggressive buyers than sellers, or vice versa.</strong>

        If buyers are more aggressive, price goes up.
        If sellers are more aggressive, price goes down.

        News doesn't move price by itself.
        Indicators don't move price.
       Price moves when  <strong>money is committed.</strong>
        Everything else is noise.</p>

    <h2>Who Is In the Market?</h2>
    <ul class="bold">
        <li>Retail traders
            <ul>
                <li>Small accounts. Emotional. Most Lose</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Institutions & funds 
            <ul>
                <li>Large money.They move price.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Banks & Liquidity providers 
            <ul>
                <li>Provide liquidity. Control Flow</li>

            </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Price respects levels because big money has business there.
    </p>

    <h2>Why most beginners lose</h2>
    <p>Because they:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>chase entries</li>
        <li>ignore risk</li>
        <li>trade every move</li>
        <li>Thinks the market "owes" them</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The market does not care about your account.
        It does not know you exist.

        If you don't respect that, it will take your money.
    </p>

<h2>What this means for you as a trader</h2>
<p>
    Your job is not to predict.
    Your job is to react.

    You wait.
    You observe.
    You protect capital.

    Survive first.
    Profit comes later.

    If you understand this, you're already ahead.

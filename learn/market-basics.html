      <h1>🧠 Lesson 1: What a Market Really Is</h1>

      <h2>What Are We Actually Trading?</h2>
      <p>
        You are not trading indicators. <br />
        You are not trading patterns. <br />
        You are not trading lines on a chart. <br />
        <br />
        You are trading <strong>people making decisions with money.</strong
        ><br />
        <br />
        Every candle exists because someone bought and someone sold. <br />
        That's it. No magic. <br />
        <br />
        Price moves because <strong>orders hit the market.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Why Price Moves (The Simple Truth)</h2>
      <p>
        Price only moves for one reason: <br />
        <br />
        <strong
          >&vert; More aggressive buyers than sellers, or vice versa.</strong
        ><br />
        <br />
        If buyers are more aggressive, price goes up. <br />
        If sellers are more aggressive, price goes down. <br />
        <br />
        News doesn't move price by itself. <br />
        Indicators don't move price. <br />
        Price moves when <strong>money is committed.</strong> <br />
        <br />
        Everything else is noise.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Is In the Market?</h2>
      <ul class="bold">
        <li>
          Retail traders
          <ul>
            <li>Small accounts. Emotional. Most Lose</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Institutions & funds
          <ul>
            <li>Large money.They move price.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Banks & Liquidity providers
          <ul>
            <li>Provide liquidity. Control Flow</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Price respects levels because big money has business there.</p>

      <h2>Why most beginners lose</h2>
      <p>Because they:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chase entries</li>
        <li>Ignore risk</li>
        <li>Trade every move</li>
        <li>Thinks the market "owes" them</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The market does not care about your account. <br />
        It does not know you exist. <br />
        <br />
        If you don't respect that, it will take your money.
      </p>

      <h2>What this means for you as a trader</h2>
      <p>
        Your job is not to predict. <br />
        Your job is to react. <br />
        <br />
        You wait. <br />
        You observe. <br />
        You protect capital. <br />
        <br />
        Survive first. <br />
        Profit comes later. <br />
        <br />
        If you understand this, you're already ahead.
